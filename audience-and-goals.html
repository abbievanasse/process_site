						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, we determined who our audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Defining the Audience</h2>
					<p>In order to make the website redesign as effective and efficient as possible, the next step was to figure out who the target audiences are for the website. This process began by using upside-down triangle thinking. First, a broad, overall auidience was determined in which everyone who interacts with the organization was considered. From there, the groups gradually became more and more specific and placed into certain categories of audineces. </p>
			
		
			<!--AUDIENCE & GOALS-->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 1.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the overall categorized audience of Independent Grounds Coffee House. This categorized group defines all specific audiences that interact with the organization. The broadest categories consist of those directly involved with the company and those who are indirectly involved. These groups are then further broken down into smaller groups. Directly involved are two main groups: those who are "getting help" and those who are "giving help." Indirectly involved are also two main groups: possible "skeptics" of the company and "fans" of the company.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 2.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the first specific group that falls under the group <i>directly</i> involved with the company: Those "getting help." This group consists of people with special needs and developmental delays who work for Independent Grounds Coffee House in order to gain work experience that will better prepare them for future jobs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 3.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the second specific group that falls under the group <i>directly</i> involved with the company: Those "giving help." Under this group of people are those who want to help out or volunteer, staff, those looking to support a good cause, donators, coffee companies, coffee lovers, families whith children who have special needs or developmental delays, and churches. All of these people have the common goal of supporting a cause greater than themselves.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 4.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the first specific group that falls under the group <i>indirectly</i> involved with the company: Possible skeptics. The first group on this list concerns the people wondering where exactly all of Independent Grounds' funds go since they make money through selling coffee but are non-profit. The second group on this list concerns people who may be wondering about the relation between Independent Grounds and Counter Culture Coffee, the company whose coffeee they sell. Questions concerned here may be: Does Counter Culture know that Independent Grounds is buying and re-selling their coffee? Does Counter Culture know that the proceeds go towards a greater cause? 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 5.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the second specific group that falls under the group <i>indirectly</i> involved with the company: "Fans" of the organization. The first group on this list concerns those who love coffee; specifically Counter Culture Coffee. They would be a group who would go to the cart and buy coffee not only because of the cause, but because they are selling something that attracts them. The second group on this list concerns families with a member undergoing similar struggles as those who work for Independent Grounds. This group understands the cause from a much different perspective and will really be drawn to the coffee cart because of what they are accomplishing as a company.</p>
