						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, we determined who our audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Defining the Audience</h3>
					<p>In order to make the website redesign as effective and efficient as possible, the next step was to figure out who the target audiences are for the website. This process began by using upside-down triangle thinking. First, a broad, overall auidience was determined in which everyone who interacts with the organization was considered. From there, the groups gradually became more and more specific and placed into certain categories of audineces. </p>

				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the overall categorized audience of Independent Grounds Coffee House. This categorized group defines all specific audiences that interact with the organization. The broadest categories consist of those directly involved with the company and those who are indirectly involved. These groups are then further broken down into smaller groups. Directly involved are two main groups: those who are "getting help" and those who are "giving help." Indirectly involved are also two main groups: possible "skeptics" of the company and "fans" of the company.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 2.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the first specific group that falls under the group directly involved with the company: Those "getting help." This group consists of people with special needs and developmental delays who work for Independent Grounds Coffee House in order to gain work experience that will better prepare them for future jobs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 3.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the second specific group that falls under the group directly involved with the company: Those "giving help." Under this group of people are those who want to help out or volunteer, staff, those looking to support a good cause, donators, coffee companies, coffee lovers, families whith children who have special needs or developmental delays, and churches. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 4.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>When it came down to refining my audience in this exercise, I focused on the categories
						<i>Audience (as an Organization)</i> and <i>Audience (Consumers/Earth Market)</i>. I found that
						these two categories directly represented the main audience I wanted to reach.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 5.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>I soon found that there were some audiences that fit into multiple categories. I wanted to cover
						all my bases, so I wedged them between columns to show interchangability. It was hard narrowing
						them down even further and deciding which section of the determined audience would fit best.</p>
