						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, we determined who our audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Defining the Audience</h3>
					<p>In order to make the website redesign as effective and efficient as possible, the next step was to figure out who the target audiences are for the website. This process began by using upside-down triangle thinking. First, a broad, overall auidience was determined in which everyone who interacts with the organization was considered. From there, the groups gradually became more and more specific and placed into certain categories of audineces. </p>
			
		
			<!--AUDIENCE & GOALS-->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 1.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the overall categorized audience of Independent Grounds Coffee House. This categorized group defines all specific audiences that interact with the organization. The broadest categories consist of those directly involved with the company and those who are indirectly involved. These groups are then further broken down into smaller groups. Directly involved are two main groups: those who are "getting help" and those who are "giving help." Indirectly involved are also two main groups: possible "skeptics" of the company and "fans" of the company.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 2.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the first specific group that falls under the group <i>directly</i> involved with the company: Those "getting help." This group consists of people with special needs and developmental delays who work for Independent Grounds Coffee House in order to gain work experience that will better prepare them for future jobs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 3.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the second specific group that falls under the group <i>directly</i> involved with the company: Those "giving help." Under this group of people are those who want to help out or volunteer, staff, those looking to support a good cause, donators, coffee companies, coffee lovers, families whith children who have special needs or developmental delays, and churches. All of these people have the common goal of supporting a cause greater than themselves.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 4.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the first specific group that falls under the group <i>indirectly</i> involved with the company: Possible skeptics. The first group on this list concerns the people wondering where exactly all of Independent Grounds' funds go since they make money through selling coffee but are non-profit. The second group on this list concerns people who may be wondering about the relation between Independent Grounds and Counter Culture Coffee, the company whose coffeee they sell. Questions concerned here may be: Does Counter Culture know that Independent Grounds is buying and re-selling their coffee? Does Counter Culture know that the proceeds go towards a greater cause? 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience image 5.jpeg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
				<div class="8u$">
					<p>Shown here is the second specific group that falls under the group <i>indirectly</i> involved with the company: "Fans" of the organization. The first group on this list concerns those who love coffee; specifically Counter Culture Coffee. They would be a group who would go to the cart and buy coffee not only because of the cause, but because they are selling something that attracts them. The second group on this list concerns families with a member undergoing similar struggles as those who work for Independent Grounds. This group understands the cause from a much different perspective and will really be drawn to the coffee cart because of what they are accomplishing as a company.</p>

			<h3>The Interviews</h3>

			<p>Due to not being able to get in contact witht the company to schedule an interview with a direct employee of Independent Grounds, I scheduled interviews with two potential audeince members of different categories as another means of gathering information. Both of these interviews were extremely helpful when thinking about design choices for the new website.</p>

				<h4>Interview 1: Potential Audience Member</h4>
				<p>This interview was completed with a potential audience member of Independent Grounds Coffee House. The interviewee, who is a close friend of mine, is from the Charleston area and a huge coffee lover. Because she fits into one of the main audience groups, I found her a perfect fit for this.</p>
				<p>The first things that would have attracted her attention is the fact that they sell coffee but do so to help a greater cause. She stated that because of the inspiring mission of the people who started the business, she would be more likely to buy coffee from them due to the fact that she knows that the money would be going towards a bigger purpose.</p>
				<p>The main reason she would visit the website is to further learn about the organization, their goal, and details about where proceeds go. Because of this, it is important to me to make the organization’s purpose clear and easy to find on the website. I would like to include a brief summary on the home page of the website about what Independent Grounds does. Having the knowledge that they are a non-profit organization looking to give employment opportunities to those with special needs leads people to purchase from, give, and volunteer not because of the coffee, but because they know where the money will be going. The coffee is a smart means of attracting people, but the underlying goal is what leads people to take action.</p>
				<p>Another important thing she mentioned that she would look for on the website is an easy to find CTA or such that gives clear indication on where and how to donate or volunteer for the organization. Because of this, I would like to create buttons or other clear indicators on the website which clearly show both of these as well.</p>
		
				<h4>Interview 2: Potential Audience Member</h4>
				<p>This interview was completed with another potential audience member and a member of the “fans” audience category of Independent Grounds Coffee House. The interviewee was a parent of a child who has developmental disabilities. Because she understands the different struggles from a very direct standpoint, I thought she would be another perfect person to interview. </p>
				<p>Not only did the parent say that she would not hesitate to donate, buy from, or volunteer for the organization, but she also said that that she would even look into getting her child involved with a business such as this. She stated that it would be such a great opportunity and that there would be so many benefits through it.  Knowing this information, I would also like to make a clear place on the website on how to get involved. This would concern how to volunteer and help, as well as how to actually get a child involved with the business as an employee. I plan to do this through another CTA button so that it stands out and is easy to find.</p>
