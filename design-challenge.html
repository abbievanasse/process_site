					<h4> The Problem Being Solved</h4>
						<p>To improve the work lives of those with special needs and developmental delays.</p>
					<h4> The Design Question</h4>
						<p>How might the Independent Grounds Coffee House website help in working to improve the work lives of those with special needs and developmental delays?</p>
					<h4> The Ultimate Impact</h4>
						<p>Through the website, drive people to offer more donations and purchase more products in order to support the cause of the company to improve the work lives of those with special needs and developmental delays.</p>
					<h4> Possible Solutions</h4>
						<p>Overall hierarchy on the website, the goals of the company clearly displayed on the homepage, and a site that will make people want to support the company through donations and purchasing products.</p>
					<h4> Context and Constraints</h4>
						<p>The company is only located in Charleston, South Carolina, but are looking to reach people of all ages. Although close to their location, it may be difficult to directly get all of the information I need from them. They are a fairly small organization as well, which may also create some difficulty in the rebranding process. There is also a lack of high-resolution images concerning the organization.</p>
					<h4>The New Design Question</h4>
						<p>How can the Independent Grounds Coffee House website help to promote sales and encourage donations in order to help in improving the lives of people with special needs and developmental delays?</p>
